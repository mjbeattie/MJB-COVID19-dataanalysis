This is a set of files that includes visualizaiton, downloaded data, and a utilities for pulling COVID19 data
<br>

<b>NYC-covid-scraper.ipynb:</b><br>
A Jupyter notebook that scrapes the daily data from the NYC Health COVID-19 website into a daily CSV file.  Because NYC publishes their data in PDF format, it is difficult to use.  This scraper allows the researcher to automatically generate a table of useful data.  The CSV file is structured in normal form for use with RDBMS applications. <b>Note that NYC changes its PDF format.</b>  Unfortunately, I can't guarantee this will always work.  You may have to adjust the regex codes.
